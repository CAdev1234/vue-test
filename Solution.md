# Vue Test Challenge

This should be helpful to get some understanding about me.
This project is a multi-step form where user can fill in information, get price and buy an insurance policy.

## Tech Stack
It was built using Typescript, Vue3 in Vite and TailwindCSS CDN, also without any third libraries.
Especially Options API is still supported by Vue Ecosystem, but Composition API is main feature in Vue 3 pushing the Options API out.
This was developed with Composition API.
